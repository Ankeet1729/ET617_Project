      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The transcript highlights the use of functions (or modules) to make the karaoke code more organized and easier to manage, particularly for different stanzas of the song.",

      "options": ["It's always 90 degrees.", "It's 360 degrees divided by the number of edges.", "It's determined randomly.", "It's a fixed value depending on the shape."],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The transcript explicitly explains the calculation of the angle of rotation as 360 degrees divided by the number of edges for different shapes (triangle, square, hexagon).",
