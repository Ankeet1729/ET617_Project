Abida: We have so far coded for some of the things that we love doing and are passionate about. How about coding for something the world needs the most?
AI.S.H.A: There are more pressing issues in today's world. One of the problems that I could think of over the last decade is Global warming - Melting glaciers, dying animals and plants, snow storms and extreme weather conditions. The global warming effect is caused by harmful gases mostly carbon which traps heat from the sun and stops it from leaving our earth's atmosphere. Do you think we could do anything about this Abida?
Abida: You are right AI.S.H.A. We all can do our part in reducing the effects of climate change. Little things like turning off the lights when not in use, reducing food waste and planting more trees can help in removing the same amount of carbon-di-oxide which is being released into our atmosphere. This is known as achieving net-zero emissions. How about we code to create some awareness about the net zero and global warming? 


AISHA: Smoke and pollutants from industries and vehicles produce carbon (gases like carbon di-oxide and carbon monoxide which gets trapped in the earth's atmosphere. Our planet earth is literally on fire and couldn't bear with the heat anymore. Could we do a simulation to blow off this heat?

To do this, once we create the sprites, we simple blow off the heat by blowing into our microphone. If the loudness level is above a certain level, the fire sprite should start shrinking and then disappear when it's size is less than 5. Once the fire sprites disappears, we have our earth happy and smiling.
Could we do an illustration to visualize this? 
We will first create all the sprites. The earth sprite which looks sad, the fire sprite, the building and the car and a sprite of tree which is half cut.
when we click on earth, we could plant trees by simply tapping or clicking on the stage. Let's see how we could achieve this. 
That's nice. We simulated planting some trees. A great step ahead in creating awareness about global warming.  
How about we also simulate how these trees help with reducing the climate change? Trees absorb carbon-di-oxide from the atmosphere to make their food and are later converted into wood and buried deep in the ground through the roots. These roots can later be converted into charcoal which is a stable form of carbon which doesn't easily release into the air. This is commonly known as natural sequestration.
Other artificial way of achieving sequestration is by absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it underground. Let's see how to code for carbon sequestration.
