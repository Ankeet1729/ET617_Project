    Generates a quiz from a transcript, tailored to a specific grade level

        transcript: The learning material text.
        grade: The target educational stage based on NEP. 
               Expected values: "foundational", "preparatory", "middle", "secondary".

    You are an expert in educational psychology and curriculum design. 
    Your task is to generate a pedagogically sound quiz from the provided learning material,
    keeping the learner's cognitive development in mind.

    ### Input Parameters
    1. Grade Level: {grade}
    2. Transcript: Provided at the end.

    ### Instructions
    1.  Read the entire transcript to understand the core concepts.
    2.  Generate a quiz with exactly:
        - {no_of_mcq} Multiple Choice Questions (4 options each, one correct).
        - {no_of_tf} True/False Questions.
    3.  **Grade-Level Adaptation (Based on NEP 5+3+3+4 System):**
        - **foundational (Grades 1-2):** Use very simple language. Questions should be direct and concrete. Focus on "Remembering."
        - **preparatory (Grades 3-5):** Use simple, clear language. Introduce questions that require basic "Understanding" and connections.
        - **middle (Grades 6-8):** Use standard terminology. Questions should test "Application" of concepts and basic "Analysis."
        - **secondary (Grades 9-12):** Use precise, academic language. Questions should challenge learners with "Analysis," "Evaluation," and synthesis of information.
    4.  **Cognitive Diversity (Based on Bloom's Taxonomy):**
        - Structure the quiz to have a gradual increase in cognitive demand.
        - Start with Lower-Order Thinking Skills (LOTS) and move to Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS).
        - Distribute questions across these levels as appropriate for the grade:
            - **Remembering:** Recalling facts and basic concepts.
            - **Understanding:** Explaining ideas or concepts.
            - **Applying:** Using information in new situations.
            - **Analyzing:** Drawing connections among ideas.
            - **Evaluating:** Justifying a stand or decision.
    5.  **Question Quality:**
        - Ensure questions are unambiguous and directly based on the transcript's terminology.
        - The goal is to test comprehension and critical thinking, not just rote memorization.
    6.  Provide a concise explanation for each answer, referencing the core concept from the transcript.

# Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. 
# During photosynthesis, these organisms take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. Using light energy
# from the sun, they convert these ingredients into glucose, which is a sugar that provides energy for the plant to grow. 
# A byproduct of this process is oxygen, which is released into the atmosphere. This process primarily occurs in the 
# chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain a pigment called chlorophyll. It is chlorophyll that absorbs the light energy
# and gives plants their green color. The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy â†’ 
# C6H12O6 + 6O2. This process is fundamental to life on Earth as it produces the oxygen we breathe and is the foundation
# of most food chains.
